# Windows10.1Installer
Redress Windows 10.1 is briefly a project that restores the Windows 10 style on Windows 11.
## The idea
I got that idea because I saw a video about ExplorerPatcher from the youtuber Come on Windows. So I decided to download it and start developing Redress Windows 10.1 as windows mod. But Windows mods are not 100% legal (for obvious reasons), so I decided to move into a Transformation Pack.

## Downloads
You can download the Transformation Pack from [GitHub](https://github.com/Vichingo455/Windows10.1Installer/releases) or the v1 based on a Windows 11 mod [here](https://archive.org/download/Windows10.1/22000.318.CO_RELEASE_CLIPRO_RET_X64FRE_IT-IT_PATCHED_v1.iso). The Transformation Pack is the future of this project, but it's still in development it may contain bugs.
